If you would like to add yourself or your organisation to the map, [this is how](https://github.com/ciudadanointeligente/home-poplus/wiki).

People all over the world are involved in Poplus. We can't always meet up in the same place, so we make very good use of online spaces!

Here's where you can talk and collaborate on current Poplus projects.

### Mailing list

Our [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/poplus) is the main place for discussions of all sorts.

### Hackpad

We use [Hackpad](https://popluscon.hackpad.com/) for collaborative note-taking, agendas, and notes from meetings.

### IRC

For instant chat, find us on #poplus on [Freenode](https://webchat.freenode.net/)

### Trello

[Trello](https://trello.com) is where we discuss and prioritise work tasks. There's a board specifically for [ideas for new Components](https://trello.com/b/5gGF4xrJ/ideas-for-new-poplus-components).

### Github

Poplus Components are all Open Source. You can find their code or add tickets for bugs or suggested changes on Github.

See the [Components page](http://poplus.org/components/) for links.
